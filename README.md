# Discuss IT - Elixir and Phoenix Reddit clone

The goals of this project were to have a big enough toy application to learn Elixir as well as Phoenix. In order to focus majority of the resources towards learning the stack, the problem choosen is simple enough to get started quickly as well as complex enough when we increase the feature set.


Currently, the project contains the following:
- Full Stack Phoenix Application
- OAuth using Github
- CRUD for Topics, Users and Comments
- Socket/Channel implementation for wiring out new comments across topics
- Auth protected comments and topic deletion and edit functionalities

Next Steps:
- [ ] Deployment on Heroku/AWS
- [ ] OAuth using Google
- [ ] Scopes on models and more Ecto goodies
- [ ] Caching Topics
- [ ] Email service
- [ ] Notifications/Subscription services
- [ ] Async functionality for non blocking operations like sending emails, pushing things, creating newletters to cache etc.
